Welcome to Shop & Co!

Fork this repo and you'll have a store to shop in, but no products! Add a new stock on the inventory page, but be careful to make sure you include all the fields. After adding some stock, you can jump over to the shop page and play around with which items you want to add (or delete) from you cart. You can only pick up as many items as are on the shelf though, but don't worry - your shop will let you know when there's no more of a certain stock left. Click purchase for always satisfying order placed message, and check out the changes in inventory - whatever you've bought is no longer included in the stock count.

Development Notes:

Currently, all of my react components are living in a script on the application.html.erb page. In the real world, each component would be extracted into a different file for readability. Due to time constraints, I didn't have time to break everything out into files... The added complexity of using JSX meant that I'd have to add a transpiler like babel over my asset pipeline. 

TL;DR I can't wait to chat about this project and discuss some of my design decisions and ways to improve. :)
